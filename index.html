        <p class="desc"> Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish made by layering wide, flat noodles with rich meat sauce, creamy
            béchamel or ricotta mixture, and plenty of melted cheese. To prepare it, ground beef is first sautéed with
            garlic and onions, then simmered in tomato sauce seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil. In a baking
            dish,
            cooked lasagna noodles are layered with the meat sauce, a mixture of ricotta and egg (or béchamel sauce),
            and
            shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. These layers are repeated until the dish is full, finishing with a
            generous topping of cheese. The lasagna is then baked in a preheated oven until bubbly and golden on top.
            After
            resting for a few minutes, it is sliced and served warm, offering a comforting and flavorful meal perfect
            for
            family gatherings or special occasions.</p>
